# Sprint 232 Demo

## Highlights

- REST API for Results
- OpenShift Pipelines 1.9 Upgrade

## Demo Notes

- Run the Pipeline Service test script beforehand. This gives us enough
  pipelineruns to work with.
- `cat` of the TaskRun with the git resolver doesn't work for some reason.
  Pause and show the file manually.
